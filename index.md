## Hello and welcome!
I am a 4th year PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/" target="_blank">Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="http://tcd.ie" target="_blank">Trinity College Dublin</a>. My research focuses on the interaction between civil-military relations, ethnicity, gender, and colonialism. In my dissertation, <em>Essays on the Impact of Conscription on Marginalized Groups</em>, I investigate the determinants of ethnically selective conscription and explore the impact of conscription on citizenship and political and civic engagement of ethnic minorities and women. I employ both a global comparative analysis and a case study of Israel/Palestine. This involves a mixed methods approach, including original interview data I collected during fieldwork in summer of 2023.

I hold a MA in International Relations from <a href="http://cuni.cz" target="_blank">Charles University in Prague</a>, and a BA in Political Science and European Studies from <a href="http://upol.cz" target="_blank">Palack√Ω University in Olomouc</a>. More detailed information on my work, research and teaching experience can be found in my [CV](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf).

**Research interests:**
- Civil-Military Relations
- Gender and Ethnic Relations
- Colonial Legacies
- Middle Eastern Politics and Societies: Israel/Palestine, Druzes
- Research Methodology: Quantitative and Qualitative (Fieldwork and Interviewing)
