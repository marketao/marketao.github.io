## Hello and welcome!
I am a final-year PhD candidate at the <a href='https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/' target='_blank'>Department of Political Science</a> at <a href='http://tcd.ie' target='_blank'>Trinity College Dublin</a>. In my dissertation <em>Essays on the Impact of Conscription on Marginalized Groups</em> I examine the impact of conscription on gender and ethnic relations. I employ a mixed methods approach, using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. I have experience conducting fieldwork in conflict-affected regions.

I hold a MA in International Relations from <a href="http://cuni.cz" target="_blank">Charles University in Prague</a>, and a BA in Political Science and European Studies from <a href="http://upol.cz" target="_blank">Palacký University in Olomouc</a>. More detailed information on my research and teaching experience can be found in my **[CV](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf)**.

As my PhD dissertation submission approaches in August 2024, **I am currently seeking a position as postdoctoral researcher, research assistant, or adjunct lecturer.**
