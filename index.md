## Hello and welcome!
I am a final-year PhD candidate at the <a href='https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/' target='_blank'>Department of Political Science</a> at <a href='http://tcd.ie' target='_blank'>Trinity College Dublin</a>. In my dissertation <em>Essays on the Impact of Conscription on Marginalised Groups</em> I examine the impact of military recruitment policies on various aspects of gender and ethnic relations. I do so through employing a mixed methods approach, using various qualitative and quantitative methods. I am experienced in planning and executing fieldwork in conflict-impacted regions, including conducting interviews.

I have accumulated almost four years of teaching experience at Trinity College Dublin. In my capacity as the Head Teaching Assistant for the past two years, I have successfully led and supported a teaching team of nine, facilitating the delivery of the Introduction to Political Science module to nearly 460 students, showcasing my strong organisational skills. In acknowledgment of my contributions to teaching at Trinity College Dublin, I was awarded the üèÜ <a href="https://twitter.com/TCD_SSP/status/1663846299651694593" target="_blank">2023 Dermot McAleese Award</a>.

In addition to my academic background, I've gained valuable experience in diplomacy and social media marketing. These roles have contributed to developing strong communication skills, effective team leadership, efficient time management, and a successful track record of organising various events, including workshops and conferences.

**More detailed information on my research and teaching experience can be found in my ‚û°Ô∏è [CV](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf).**

**As my PhD dissertation submission approaches in August 2024 üéì, I am currently seeking a position as postdoctoral researcher, research assistant, or adjunct lecturer.**
