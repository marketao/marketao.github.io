## About

I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Political Science at <a href="http://tcd.ie" target="_blank">Trinity College Dublin</a>. My research focuses on the interaction between civil-military relations, ethnicity, gender, and colonialism. In my dissertation, <em>Essays on the Impact of Conscription on Marginalized Groups</em>, I investigate the determinants of ethnically selective conscription and explore the impact of military institutions on citizenship and political and civic engagement of ethnic minorities and women. To do so, I employ both a global comparative analysis and a case study of Israel/Palestine. This involves a mixed methods approach, including original interview data I collected during fieldwork in 2023.

I hold a MA in International Relations from <a href="http://cuni.cz" target="_blank">Charles University in Prague</a>, and a BA in Political Science and European Studies from <a href="http://upol.cz" target="_blank">Palack√Ω University in Olomouc</a>. More information can be found in my [CV](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf).
