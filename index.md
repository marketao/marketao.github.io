## Hello and welcome!
I am an interdisciplinary social scientist interested in gender and ethnicity in civil-military relations and the politics of identity. In my research, I employ a mixed methods approach by integrating qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. I have experience in conducting interviews and planning and executing fieldwork in conflict-affected regions. I am dedicated to conducting creative, collaborative research that generates social impact.

I am currently a final-year PhD Candidate at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/) at [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie). I hold a BA in Political Science and European Studies from [Palacky University Olomouc](https://www.upol.cz/en/) and an MA in International Relations from [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html).

As the submission of my PhD dissertation *Essays on the Impact of Military Recruitment Policies on Gender and Ethnic Relations* approaches in September 2024 🎓, I am currently seeking a position as a (postdoctoral) researcher or analyst, with experience and skills adaptable to academia, government, NGOs, or the private sector.

For further details about my research, teaching experience, and professional background, please refer to my <a href="assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> or reach out to me at <a href="mailto:odlovm@tcd.ie">odlovm@tcd.ie</a>.
