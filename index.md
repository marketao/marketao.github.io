## Hello and Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Baltic Sea Region Research](https://ifzo.uni-greifswald.de/en/) at the University of Greifswald, as part of the [Security Architecture in the Baltic Sea Region](https://ifzo.uni-greifswald.de/en/research/fragmented-transformations/translate-to-english-sicherheitsarchitektur-im-ostseeraum/) project team. I hold a PhD in Political Science from [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie). My dissertation, *Essays on the Impact of Military Recruitment Policies on Gender and Ethnic Relations*, was funded by the Provost's PhD Project Award. I also hold an MA in International Relations from [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html), during which I spent a year studying at the [University of Haifa](https://uhaifa.org), and a BA in Political Science and EU Studies from [Palacký University Olomouc](https://www.upol.cz/en/). Beyond academia, I have gained professional experience in diplomacy and the private sector.

My research focuses on civil-military relations. I am particularly interested in how military recruitment influences public opinion and intersects with gender and ethnic dynamics. My work combines qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, surveys, experiments, and time-series analysis. I have experience planning and conducting fieldwork in conflict-affected regions. I am committed to producing creative, collaborative, and inclusive research that generates meaningful social and political impact.
