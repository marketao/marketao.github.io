## Hello and welcome!
I am an interdisciplinary social scientist with expertise in gender and politics, ethnic and gender relations, and civil-military relations. In my research, I employ a mixed methods approach through integrating qualitative and quantitative research methods. I am experienced in conducting interviews and planning and executing fieldwork in conflict-impacted regions.

I am currently a final-year PhD Candidate at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/) at [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie). I hold a BA in Political Science and European Studies from [Palacky University Olomouc](https://www.upol.cz/en/) and an MA in International Relations from [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html).

I have nearly four years of teaching experience at [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie). In my capacity as the Head Teaching Assistant, I have successfully led and supported a teaching team of nine to facilitate the delivery of the Introduction to Political Science module to 460 students, showcasing my strong organisational skills. In acknowledgment of my contributions to teaching, I was awarded the üèÜ [2023 Dermot McAleese Award](https://twitter.com/TCD_SSP/status/1663846299651694593).

**More detailed information on my research, teaching and professional experience can be found in my ‚û°Ô∏è [CV](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf).**

**As the submission of my PhD dissertation *Essays on the Impact of Military Recruitment Policies on Gender and Ethnic Relations* approaches in August 2024 üéì, I am currently seeking a position as a postdoctoral researcher or as an analyst/researcher in the public or private sector.**
