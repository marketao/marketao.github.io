## About

I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Political Science at [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie), Ireland. I received my MA in International Relations from [Charles University in Prague](http://cuni.cz), Czech Republic, and a BA in Political Science from [Palack√Ω University in Olomouc](http://upol.cz), Czech Republic.

My research explores the intersections of civil-military relations, ethnic relations, gender relations, and colonialism. In my dissertation thesis, titled <em>Essays on the Impact of Conscription on Marginalized Groups</em>, I focus on explaining the determinants of ethnically selective conscription and examining how military institutions affect citizenship and the political and civic engagement of ethnic minorities and women.

More information on my research and teaching experience can be found below, or in my [CV](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf).
