## Hello and Welcome!

I am a Political Scientist, currently working as Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Baltic Sea Region Research](https://ifzo.uni-greifswald.de/en/) at the University of Greifswald, where I am part of the [Security Architecture in the Baltic Sea Region](https://ifzo.uni-greifswald.de/en/research/fragmented-transformations/translate-to-english-sicherheitsarchitektur-im-ostseeraum/) project team. I hold a PhD in Political Science from [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie), an MA in International Relations from [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html), and a BA in Political Science and EU Studies from [Palacký University Olomouc](https://www.upol.cz/en/). I also studied at the [University of Haifa](https://uhaifa.org). Beyond academia, I have gained professional experience in diplomacy and the private sector.

My research focuses on the intersection of security, conflict, intergroup relations, and public opinion. I am particularly interested in how military and security policies interact with gender and ethnic dynamics, and how they impact public opinion. My work combines qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, surveys, and experimental as well as quasi-experimental approaches. I have experience in planning and conducting fieldwork in conflict-affected regions. I am committed to producing collaborative, creative, and inclusive research that generates meaningful social and political impact.
