## Hello and welcome!
I am a 4th-year PhD candidate at the <a href='https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/' target='_blank'>Department of Political Science</a> at <a href='http://tcd.ie' target='_blank'>Trinity College Dublin</a>. My research investigates the impact of conscription on gender and ethnic relations. In my dissertation, <em>Essays on the Impact of Conscription on Marginalized Groups</em>, I examine the effects of gendered conscription on ethnic minority women, its implications for gender equality, and prevailing colonial legacies associated with ethnically selective military service. Employing both a global comparative analysis and a case study, my approach incorporates mixed methods, including original interview data collected during fieldwork in Israel/Palestine in the summer of 2023.

I hold a MA in International Relations from <a href="http://cuni.cz" target="_blank">Charles University in Prague</a>, and a BA in Political Science and European Studies from <a href="http://upol.cz" target="_blank">Palack√Ω University in Olomouc</a>. More detailed information on my research and teaching experience can be found in my [CV](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf).

As my PhD dissertation submission approaches in September 2024, **I am seeking position as
postdoctoral researcher, research assistant, or adjunct lecturer.**
