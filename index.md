## Hello and welcome!
I am a political scientist interested in ethnic and gender dynamics, civil-military relations, and politics of identity. In my research, I employ a mixed methods approach. I have experience in using various interviewing techniques and planning and executing fieldwork in conflict-affected regions. I am dedicated to conducting creative, collaborative and inclusive research that generates social and political impact.

I am currently a final-year PhD Candidate at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/) at [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie). I hold a BA in Political Science and EU Studies from [Palack√Ω University Olomouc](https://www.upol.cz/en/) and an MA in International Relations from [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html), as well as significant international experience.

As the submission of my PhD dissertation *Essays on the Impact of Military Recruitment Policies on Gender and Ethnic Relations* approaches in August 2024 üéì, I am seeking a position as a lecturer or a researcher, with experience and skills adaptable to academia, NGOs, or the private sector.

For further details about my research, teaching experience, and professional background, please refer to my <a href="assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> or reach out to me at <a href="mailto:odlovm@tcd.ie">odlovm@tcd.ie</a>.
