## Hello and welcome!
I am an interdisciplinary social scientist with expertise in gender and politics, ethnic and gender relations, and civil-military relations. In my research, I employ a mixed methods approach through integrating qualitative and quantitative research. I am experienced in conducting interviews and planning and executing fieldwork in conflict-impacted regions. I am dedicated to conducting creative, collaborative research that generates social impact.

I am currently a final-year PhD Candidate at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/) at [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie). I hold a BA in Political Science and European Studies from [Palacky University Olomouc](https://www.upol.cz/en/) and an MA in International Relations from [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html).

As the submission of my PhD dissertation *Essays on the Impact of Military Recruitment Policies on Gender and Ethnic Relations* approaches in September 2024 üéì, I am currently seeking a position as a postdoctoral researcher or as an analyst/researcher in the public or private sector.

For further details about my research, teaching experience, and professional background, please refer to my <a href="assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> or reach out to me at <a href="mailto:odlovm@tcd.ie">odlovm@tcd.ie</a>.
