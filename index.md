## Hello and Welcome!

I am a Political Scientist, currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Baltic Sea Region Research](https://ifzo.uni-greifswald.de/en/) at the University of Greifswald, where I am part of the [Security Architecture in the Baltic Sea Region](https://ifzo.uni-greifswald.de/en/research/fragmented-transformations/translate-to-english-sicherheitsarchitektur-im-ostseeraum/) project team.

I hold a PhD in Political Science from [Trinity College Dublin](http://tcd.ie). My dissertation, *Essays on the Impact of Military Recruitment Policies on Gender and Ethnic Relations*, was funded by the Provost's PhD Project Award. I also hold an MA in International Relations from [Charles University Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html), during which I spent a year studying at the [University of Haifa](https://uhaifa.org), and a BA in Political Science and EU Studies from [Palacký University Olomouc](https://www.upol.cz/en/). Beyond academia, I have gained professional experience in diplomacy and the private sector.  

My specialisation lies in the interaction between the military and society. My work combines qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, surveys, and time-series analysis. I also have experience planning and conducting fieldwork in conflict-affected regions. I am committed to producing creative, collaborative, and inclusive research that generates meaningful social and political impact.
